              is delayed, modified, or cancelled for any reason, including but
              not limited to directives issued by authorities, “force majeure”
              or any other cause beyond the control of organizer, there shall be
              no sort of refund of organizers.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Organizer is not liable for damages except in cases of intent
              or gross negligence, which shall be proved.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Organizer will take no responsibility for health risks of the
              Participant in connection with the participation in the Event. The
              Participant are aware that participation in the Event bears risks
              and that risk of serious danger and also death cannot be excluded
              by the Organizer in any case.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Participant acknowledges and agrees that it is his
              responsibility to determine whether the Participant is
              sufficiently fit and healthy enough to safely participate in the
              Event without reservations.

              consumption of alcohol and/or drugs before, during and after the
              Event and he/she recognizes that consumption of alcohol and/or
              drugs might impair his/her judgement. He/she assumes
              responsibility for any injury, loss or damage caused by his/her
              consumption of alcohol and/or drugs.
            </li>
            <li>

              the Event, the Participant declare in advance his consent with
              these measures. Medical treatments are not included and the
              Participant will be directly charged according to the general
              medical rates. The Organizer does not provide for insurance
              coverage for the medical treatment of the Participant and is not
              obliged to do so. It is in the responsibility of the Participant
              to ensure adequate insurance coverage for medical treatments. A
              liability of the Organizer is thus excluded.

              to the Participants. The Organizer shall assume no liability for
              items of the Participants stored by himself or third parties
              employed by the Organizer; the liability of the Organizer due to
              negligent selection will remain untouched.
